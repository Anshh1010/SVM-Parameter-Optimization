# SVM-Parameter-Optimization


##    Assignment    

This project aims to explore the effectiveness of Support Vector Machines (SVM) in solving classification problems, with a focus on parameter optimization. In this project, we have taken a dataset and created 10 random samples to train and test our SVM model. Our goal was to identify the best SVM parameters that can yield the highest accuracy for each of the 10 samples.

We used the Scikit-learn library in Python to implement our SVM model and optimize its parameters. The dataset we used for this project was Dry Bean Data Set. After splitting the dataset into 10 random samples, we trained and tested our SVM model using various parameter combinations.

The final result of our project is a table that shows the accuracy of each of the 10 samples, along with the best SVM parameters that yielded the highest accuracy. This table can be used as a reference for future classification problems that require SVM parameter optimization.

In an extension to the previous project, we've now added the feature of multithreading, that redices the time complexity of the entire operation by almost 50% in the best case.

##    Dataset   
###   Dry Beans      


Seven different types of dry beans were used in this research, taking into account the features such as form, shape, type, and structure by the market situation. A computer vision system was developed to distinguish seven different registered varieties of dry beans with similar features in order to obtain uniform seed classification. For the classification model, images of 13,611 grains of 7 different registered dry beans were taken with a high-resolution camera. Bean images obtained by computer vision system were subjected to segmentation and feature extraction stages, and a total of 16 features; 12 dimensions and 4 shape forms, were obtained from the grains.
